# Introduction
## :trophy: A0.1 Learning Activity
## Objective

Make the context of the case study, as well as a field interview, and finally consolidate the requirements' information using the "emphatize" phase proposed by the design thinking methodology.

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on the provided information by the teacher about design's thinking emphatize phase, develop the indicated activity from the development's section, and if necessary make a brief investigation about **tools to collect information for the customer requirements analysis**.

* Every activity or challenge must be realized using **Markdown style with .md extension** and VSCode development environment, it has to be as a **single page** document, which means if the document has images, links o another external document it must be accesed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A0.1_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**.

* As a requirement the .MD file must contain a tag of the link to the repository of your GITHUB document, for example a **Link to my GitHub** and after finishing the task it must be submitted to Github.

* From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** that must be uploaded to Classroom in the corresponding section, serving as evidence of turned in, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the activity's result.
Considering that the .PDF file was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index, which are **links to your md documents**, try not to use text to indicate internal or external links.

* It's suggested to use a structure similar to the one indicated below, however, you can use any other structure that can help you organize your repository.

## :pencil2: Development

1. Taking as base the characteristics referred in the case study and the design's thinking proposal, make a context, a listing of at least **15 questions to the client** that can give more detailed information to elaborate the analysis of the requirements about the case study.

### a) *Context*

### b) *Interview*

    1. What data should be requested to complete the registration of a user?
    2. From which devices should it be possible to access the platform?
    3. Which method do you consider the most effective for password recovery?
    4. Who could upload courses to the platform?
    5. How would you like to form your established user profile?
    6. What categories would you like the platform to have?
    7. What kind of support material do you find most useful in a course?
    8. How will it be decided if the course was approved?
    9. Would you like courses in real time or to be completed at the time you establish?
    10. How should the certificate of completion of a course be sent to the user?
    11. What information would you like to see from your courses?
    12. How long could a certificate last as valid?
    13. How long in advance should the expiration of the certificate be notified?
    14. How should expiration be notified?
    15. How could a certificate be revalidated?
    16. Any interface design requirements that should be implemented?

2. Once completed the interview indicated in the previous point, use some of the suggested technics in the design's thinking emphatize phase, you can even use any other tool, technic or artifact to consolidate the collected information from the client and elaborate your **proposal of the business model of the system to be developed.**

3. Elaborate and expose your document, considering realize the dynamic as it would be done a field job or client site, and expose to the teacher and your classmates.

### a) *Ba침uelos Mendez Jordi's Conclusion*
~~~
The developed research, along with the analysis of the case study and the interview, allowed us to have a better understanding of the functions and characteristics that we must consider for the platform; in this case, we must consider exclusive access to the members of the organization, personalize the recommended courses for each user, aspects related to the evaluation and certification, etc. All this to guarantee the security of the company, as well as to ensure the adequate training of the employees in different areas, even after the approval of the course.
~~~
### b) *Castillo Medina Edgar Antonio's Conclusion*
~~~
Based on the information collected in the interview and the analysis of those responses, it was concluded that the system must maintain good control of the users' courses and pay full attention to the expiration and revalidation times of the certificates, because try to keep the skills and abilities updated of users is a priority. The company is looking for a platform that provides security and confidence to both coordinators and employees.
~~~

### c) *Villanueva Romero Carlos Daladier's Conclusion*
~~~
Using the interview responses as a reference, it can be concluded that the platform must comply with the basic aspects that similar platforms have, with improvements designed for better interaction and understanding by the user, with the objective of a more efficient implementation and renewals of the courses offered, in such a way that the user is aware of which ones are pending as well as those that have finished and which will require revalidation in the near future.
~~~
### d) *Villegas Ramirez Luis Eduardo's Conclusion*
~~~
The information collected through the interview has given us a very deep view of how the system should be built in order to offer a complete tool with functional value for the client, from the way a user registers, to the methods of evaluation of a course, for subsequent certification, guaranteeing the qualification of those who take the courses, with a wide variety of categories, functions and tools that, in addition to satisfying customer needs, give us a competitive advantage.
