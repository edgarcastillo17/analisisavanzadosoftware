# Introduction

## :trophy: A3.3 Learning Activity
Software architecture design using C4 model

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on an investigation and the provided document by the teacher, realize the documentation for the project using scrum framework for the case study.

* The activity must be realized using a platform like **Notion**, or **Confluence**, and must be send in PDF style, named with the nomenclature **A3.3_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index.

## :pencil2: Development

1. Realize the next diagrams for the case study:
    - System Context Diagram
    - Container Diagram
    - Component Diagram
    - Class Diagram

## :paperclip: Conclusions

### a) *Ba√±uelos Mendez Jordi's Conclusion*

Unlike the diagrams developed during the previous activities, in this work it was possible to observe the behavior and structure of the system, aligning ourselves with a new perspective: the C4 model, which helped to identify the context of the system, as well as its classes, models, controllers, the tools that will compose it (mail services, alerts, etc.), and how they will interact with users in particular; that is, how it will behave according to the role with which it is interacting. All this in a very aligned way with the programming context.

### b) *Castillo Medina Edgar Antonio's Conclusion*

The C4 model was something new to me, I think that the way this model provides to analyze a system is very useful, putting more emphasis in our platform it was a clear tool to use to describe the functions and the ways the system interacts inside itself or with other systems. What did I learn from this model? That there are so many models that can be used to stablish the working of any software but once we've used this one seems pretty clearer and easier that other ones.

### c) *Villanueva Romero Carlos Daladier's Conclusion*

After completing this document, I better understood the software structuring through the C4 model and how the diagrams belonging to it should be made, if how is its visualization explaining each element in detail and then explaining its components to Through the different diagrams that are used, each of these helps to understand the different modules of the software in a better way and in this way to know with certainty how it works.

### d) *Villegas Ramirez Luis Eduardo's Conclusion*

With the diagrams made in the activity, the internal structure of the system is fully defined along with all the communications that will be carried out, in addition, we can graphically visualize the components that make up the system, both software components and the communications themselves, even we can observe the behavior that the classes used for the development of the project will have.
