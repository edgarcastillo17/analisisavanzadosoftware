### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on the provided information by the teacher about the topic and the case study, realize the project charter of the project based on the example indicated by the teacher.

* Every activity or challenge must be realized using **Markdown style with .md extension** and VSCode development environment, it has to be as a **single page** document, which means if the document has images, links o another external document it must be accesed from tags and links.

* As a requirement the .md file must contain a tag of the link to the repository of your Github document, for example a **Link to my GitHub**.

* At the end of the assignment, the .md file must be uploaded to github.

* From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** named with the nomenclature **A1.0_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**, that must be uploaded to classroom in the corresponding section, serving as evidence of turned in, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the activity's result.

## :paperclip: Conclusions

### a) *Bañuelos Mendez Jordi's Conclusion*

This activity allowed us to know the most appropiate way to elaborate this document, as well as to understand the way in which it should be structured. Specifically speaking of our project, it allowed us to identify and collect the different requirements and limitations that it will need, such as time, budget, assignment of roles for each member of the team, purposes, milestones, and other aspects that were neccesary to define, especially for the project that we will develop. Collecting all these aspects in one single formal document serves as a guide to make various considerations and clarify ambiguities before and during the development of the project.

### b) *Castillo Medina Edgar Antonio's Conclusion*

If the project wasn't clear now it starts to take shape, with the previously project charter there were a few aspects which I didn't think about it until it was necessary, thanks to the descriptions, risks, assumptions, budget and every other section in a project charter that was a little ambiguos at first now can be projected in short terms objectives. The results of realizing a document like this is the general view of the initial problem (or case study) that now with the high-level requirements, constraints and goals it turned out bigger and more complete to me and my teammates.

### c) *Villanueva Romero Carlos Daladier's Conclusion*

It is important to know how a project charter is created since this document is very recurrent in the professional area and based on the realized document I can say that there are many important aspects since here the high-level requirements begin to be established as well as you should to consider a budget that will be presented to the client. All aspects of this document are important as with the definition of the project.

### d) *Villegas Ramirez Luis Eduardo's Conclusion*

We have been able to establish certain important parameters in the preparation of the project, setting dates, costs, roles, requirements and functions that will determine the direction of the project in an orderly manner and being clear about what is going to be done as well as the possible risks that may arise at any time.
