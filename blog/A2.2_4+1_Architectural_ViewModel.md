## :trophy: A2.2 Learning Activity
4+1 Architectural View Model Documentation

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on the provided by the teacher, realize the diagrams that can be used to design the 4+1 architectural view model for the case study.

* Every activity or challenge must be realized using **Markdown style with .md extension** and VSCode development environment, it has to be as a **single page** document, which means if the document has images, links o another external document it must be accesed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A2.2_ActivityName_StudentName_Team.pdf**

* As a requirement the .md file must contain a tag of the link to the repository of your Github document, for example a **Link to my GitHub**. At the end of the assignment, the .md file must be uploaded to github.

* From the **.md** file export a **.pdf**, that must be uploaded to classroom in the corresponding section, serving as evidence of turned in, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the activity's result.

* Considering that the .pdf file was obtained from the .md file, both must be identical.

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index, which are **links to your md documents**, try not to use text to indicate internal or external links.

* It's suggested to use a structure similar to the one indicated below, however, you can use any other structure that can help you organize your repository.

## :pencil2: Development

1. Elaborate the diagrams for each one of the views stablished on the 4+1 architectural view model.

2. Each diagram must be contain at least 3 minimum elements on its representation.
    - Use Cases Diagram (include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
    - Sequence Diagram (include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
    - Class Diagram (include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
    - Package Diagram that contains the Components Diagrams (include at least 3 elements of the diagram)
    - Deployment Diagram (include at least 3 elements of the diagram)

3. Indicate through annotations the technologies that will be used, supporting from images or illustrations that represent them.

## :paperclip: Conclusions

### a) *Ba√±uelos Mendez Jordi's Conclusion*

This activity helped to compile the different specifications that we've been developing during the semester and structure them within a formal document. Said specifications involve the requirements requested by the client along with their description, graphic representation of the system capabilities, estimated budget, possible limitations, along other relevant aspects to be considered. Gathering all these elements together, in a well-planned way, suggests a precise and successful development of the project.

### b) *Castillo Medina Edgar Antonio's Conclusion*

Besides the diagrams and the logic of how the platform is gonna work were detailed and planned before, with this architecture we were provided a new and different view of all the aspects that we think we had managed, after this activity the software to be developed is clearer, simplier and easier to comprehend and analize thanks to the elements, aspects, views and diagramas that are working together to present a well-planified platform of coursed and certifications, including the tools that we're gonna use in future phases.

### c) *Villanueva Romero Carlos Daladier's Conclusion*

Based on the realized activity, I could see how important it is to identify and properly select the technologies to be used since these will affect to a greater or lesser extent the development of the project, as well as how important it is to identify it in the diagrams presented as this helps to better understand the architecture of the project to be realized.

### d) *Villegas Ramirez Luis Eduardo's Conclusion*

With the design of the architecture, it is possible to better visualize all the components and the implementation of views and diagrams helps to better understand the elements that make up the system, as well as their relationship with the technologies to be implemented in each of the different aspects.
