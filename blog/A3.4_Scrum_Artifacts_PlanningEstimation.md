# Introduction

## :trophy: A3.4 Learning Activity
Project documentation using scrum framework for the planning and estimation phase

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on an investigation and the provided document by the teacher, realize the documentation for the project using scrum framework for the case study.

* The activity must be realized using a platform like **Notion**, or **Confluence**, and must be send in PDF style, named with the nomenclature **A3.4_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index.

## :pencil2: Development

1. Join with your work team and begin to prepare what is said below:
    - 1.1 Identify the tasks for each user story.
    - 1.2 Estimate the tasks using some digital tool.
    - 1.3 Create the sprint backlog with the hours estimated tasks.
    - 1.4 Elaborate the gantt chart.
    - 1.5 Identify dependences for each task and relation them with the activity from what depends.
    - 1.6 Elaborate the burn down chart from the sprint.

2. Present this information using visual and graphics on the sprint planning meeting.

3. Place in this section evidences that prove that you reunited as a team to realize the activity.

## :paperclip: Conclusions

### a) *Ba√±uelos Mendez Jordi's Conclusion*

A good organization of activities increases the chances of developing a successful project. This activity allowed us to discuss and identify the planification of tasks using the SCRUM methodology, which although naturally can be a bit more complicated to implement, not only helped to plan the tasks that will be carried out during the first sprint, but it also allowed assign these tasks to all the members of the team, determine the days and hourse necessary to complete them, and distribute them in a way that can avoid dependencies between that prevent us from completing them in time.

### b) *Castillo Medina Edgar Antonio's Conclusion*

At the beginning all that was involved in this project looked a little overwhelming, the epics and the user stories looked like a lot to do, but once those stories are developed in tasks everything started to seem easier to comprehend, and selecting the ones that will be realized during a first sprint really helped to clarified how the project should start and how it will grow until get converted in a final producto. I think that the tools used in this documentation helps a lot to organize the members of the team, the dates and the tasks to be realized.

### c) *Villanueva Romero Carlos Daladier's Conclusion*

The definition of the tasks for each user story is quite important since the time it will take to develop the project depends on these and for this it is necessary to have a good estimate of time for each of the tasks and in the same way the know the dependencies that exist between them to know the order in which they must be developed, for this you can also implement different tools such as the development of a Burn down chart for the Sprint or the use of a Gantt chart with was in the case of this activity.

### d) *Villegas Ramirez Luis Eduardo's Conclusion*

Below we present the way in which we successfully ordered our first sprint, with the appropriate tools to be able to make dependencies between the activities and define them for each user story, which we do not use to make the selection of activities that are presented in the first sprint. which aims to deliver something of value to the client at the end of the two weeks estimated for the total duration, we distribute the activities according to the skills of each member to streamline processes and obtain better results in the product.
