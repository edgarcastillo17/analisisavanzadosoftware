## :paperclip: Conclusions

### a) *Ba√±uelos Mendez Jordi's Conclusion*

The documentation developed in this activity was useful for the identification of epics and stories from different perspectives, which means, considering needs according to the different roles that will make up the system. Discussing these aspects through dialogue and some other dynamics helped to identify the difficulty of developing these stories, the number of sprints that will be needed and which stories will make up each sprint.

### b) *Castillo Medina Edgar Antonio's Conclusion*

In previous activities we've started to take time in account and estimated the days and months that every requirement could take from our day to day, but using scrum framework is, without a doubt, an easier and clearier way with which we can organize and manage times for development dividing every task, user story or epic into sprints that bring some value to the client, and of course, helps with the organization inside the team and our ways to distribute activites.

### c) *Villanueva Romero Carlos Daladier's Conclusion*

With the completion of the Backlog and the scrum board I was able to understand how important it is to perform an analysis of user stories to be able to make a correct estimate and in this way to be able to plan the project times in the best possible way since this is a resource limited and the more realistic the estimates are, it will be possible to work correctly and focused on the tasks that require it and not take too long on tasks that are easy to complete.

### d) *Villegas Ramirez Luis Eduardo's Conclusion*

This activity helped us to integrate the SCRUM methodology in our project to define roles and also activities such as Epics and User Stories, in addition to supporting us in different tools of the methodology such as the Backlog and the Scrum Board. For all of the above, we meet as a team to define certain issues and make sure that the entire project is implemented correctly.
